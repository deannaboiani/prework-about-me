      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> Hi, I'm DeAnna Boiani, a student who decided that learning coding in 3 short months would be fun!</p>
      <p>I have been in the Sales and Marketing Industry since graduation. I first got into coding because I had a business idea, but was frustrated that I didn't know how to make the website/app for it. I started learning on my own for fun, but never jumped fully into it. I recently decided that I wasn't happy in my career choice and wanted the most efficient way to learn skills and get a job doing something I enjoy!</p>
      <h1>Where are you from...</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Schenectady, NY</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Traveling, concerts, snowboarding, hockey...anything outdoors and adventurous. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Running my own business that I built all of the infrastrusture for.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in West Seattle with my partner, 2 dogs and 2 cats.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love to create. Finding out ways to solve problems or make things work more efficiently is always something that I have enjoyed. Coding is something I never understood growing up and have always been fascinated about. The possibilities are really endless, and with someone like me who is always on the go, it's the perfefct world to dive into!</p>
